				<p>My name is Cleber (or just Binho) and currently I work as full-time iOS developer at <a href="http://metalab.co">MetaLab</a> and live in Curitiba/Paran√° with my wife and dog.</p>

				<p>I have ten years of experience with development with languages like PHP, Python, Objective-C (Learning Swift), C++, C# and databases like Oracle, Sybase, MongoDB and MySQL. I always try to write clean and maintanable code following design patterns and keeping the UI at pixel perfect level. Already worked in companies from education, telecom and bank areas and I try to always learn more and more.</p>

				<p>In my spare time I like to work in personal projects and <a href="http://planetofvisions.tumblr.com">take some photos</a>.</p>
